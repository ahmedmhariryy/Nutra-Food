## State Management

Global state lives in a single reducer. No Redux, no Zustand.

```js
// Actions
FETCH_PRODUCTS_START;
FETCH_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS;
FETCH_PRODUCTS_ERROR;
ADD_TO_CART;
INCREMENT_QUANTITY;
DECREMENT_QUANTITY;
REMOVE_FROM_CART;
TOGGLE_FAVORITE;
SET_SEARCH_TERM;
SET_CATEGORY;
SET_PRICE_RANGE;
SET_RATING_FILTER;
```

Cart and favorites are saved to localStorage on every change via `useEffect` in `StoreProvider`.

## Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint        | Behavior                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `> 1700px`        | Full layout, large banner text             |
| `1080px – 1700px` | Reduced banner padding, smaller title font |
| `< 1080px`        | Stacked banner, burger menu, mobile nav    |
| `< 768px`         | Single column layouts, compact cards       |
| `< 576px`         | Grid-based cart and favorites items        |
